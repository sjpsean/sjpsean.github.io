### Why do we need Big-O notation?

> To scale the quality of code by seeing **number of operations (or the degree of increase) that are needed when the elements (or input) increases.**

or in other words..

> To analyze **how many steps a program will take (the performance behavior of an algorithm) with regards to an increasing amount of input.**

We use big-o to measure why some data structures are better than others in specific situation.  

Right Data Structures + Right Algorithms = Good Programs

> It is not about how much time it takes, but more about **how many steps it takes to perform.**

- What can cause time in a function?
    - Operations (+, -, *, /)
    - Comparisons (<, >, ==)
    - Looping (for, while)
    - Outside function call (function())
