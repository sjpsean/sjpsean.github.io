Reference to something else in memeory. In other words, it works as an address of a value or a data.

Pointer is simply something that is pointing. It only points, so pointer itself is only an address, but we can access to the value that is stored at the address using pointers.

Dynamically allocated blocks such as arrays or objects usually are stored as a pointer. 

```jsx
let a = {} // object 
let b = a // this means b has the address of object which a is pointing too.
```
