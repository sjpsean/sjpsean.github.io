## Interview tips

[How to: Work at Google - Example Coding/Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw)

1. Ask for clarification for the interview question.
2. Constantly think out loud. It helps the interviewer to see my thought process.
3. Think through what I want to do before I start writing.
4. Test it after writing the code. Think of edge cases.



- Before solving the problem

What is the most important value of the problem? Time, space, or memory? What is the main goal? How big is the input and what kind of return do we want?

- Start solving the problem

Start with naive/brute force approach, which is the easiest and less efficient way of solving the problem. 

Just speak about it and show how inefficient it is that we need a better solution.

Come up with better solution according to time / space efficiency they want.
