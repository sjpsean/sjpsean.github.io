### 09 Jan 2022 journal

Maybe I could use my Sundays to write down what I have felt during the past week.  

The environment has been the best for me to focus on this goal of "learning and recording every day", because of the situation I am in. There were more days that I wanted to do more than what I have planned to do, but I needed to hold myself to not overwhelm myself. I am trying to make it as a habit, and it is not just a one day thing.  

I am glad I challenged myself to do this. I can see how much more I can improve by going one step at a time than trying to leap few steps at once.
